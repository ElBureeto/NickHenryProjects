to signin with username: test password: pass

# Software Engineering Project -- Modification of Augur
For out Software Engineering class we participated in 4 sprints in which was modified a GitHub project called Augur.
This included all the documentation and requirements as well as the actual coding itself. I worked personally on most of 
the documentation as well as the Archive Use case. We had to use a combination of Python, Vue, and SQL to get each of these
use cases to run properly.

# Databases Final Project
Unlike the other two projects, I am not able to link to a website. However, the folder labeled Group30_Source holds
examples of my work in SQL
